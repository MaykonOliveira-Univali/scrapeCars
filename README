How lazy can I be making a dataset of car images

car make and models derived from: https://github.com/n8barr/automotive-model-year-data
most popular car colors : http://www.forbes.com/pictures/egdh45ijhf/1-white/#413d9991b1d4

-----
general workflow:
  make a datafile of all the URLS to crawl
  use datafile to download the URLS to local files
  verify the filetypes are accurate (only want images)
  verify the file contents using resenet50 (only want images containing a specific thing..)
  generate additional classes/tags for future training
